# mini-soc-lab

Objective

The Mini SOC Lab project aims to create a hands-on cybersecurity environment for learning threat detection and security operations. This lab will simulate real-world attack scenarios, allowing for the analysis of security events using the ELK stack. The primary focus is to configure, attack, detect, and investigate security incidents while integrating a ticketing system for structured response and documentation.

Skills Learned

-Setting up and configuring the ELK stack as a SIEM.
-Analyzing security events using Kibana.
-Simulating cyber attacks and investigating incidents.
-Creating security alerts and dashboards for better visibility.
-Integrating and managing a ticketing system for incident tracking.
-Understanding adversary techniques through hands-on C2 operations.

Tools Used

-ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log ingestion, analysis, and visualization.
-Windows and Linux Servers to simulate enterprise environments.
-osTicket for managing and tracking security incidents.
-Mythic C2 for adversary emulation and red team exercises.
-Kali Linux/Metasploit to generate realistic attack scenarios.
